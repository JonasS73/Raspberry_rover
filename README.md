# Raspberry_rover
Information to build and code a rover consisting of: a raspberry pi ( 3 ) module, a motorboard (and motors) and a chassis.
the code is written in python. I included the option to use a wii remote to guide the rover.

This project has the status "unfinished". 
    this means: It is possibly simply not working.
