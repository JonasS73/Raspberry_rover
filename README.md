# Raspberry_rover
Information to build and code a rover consisting of: a raspberry pi ( 3 ) module, a motorboard (and motors) and a chassis.
the code is written in python. I included the option to use a wii remote to guide the rover( not yet uploaded).

This project has the status "in progress". 
    this means: It is possibly simply not working.
    
    Right now the only thing it can do is blink an LED when an object is within 10 cm.

# Problems you may have
If  your rover does not turn on time in autonomous mode, you can change the threshold_distance. This is distance the rover has to react to the obstacle. Try setting it to 0.2 instead of 0.1 .
